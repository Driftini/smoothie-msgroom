# Smoothie for MsgRoom
This is a Windows96 MsgRoom port of my **Smoothie** theme, intended to resemble the smooth and gradient rich aesthetics of old OSes and apps.

It also adds a few simple animations to further improve the user experience!

## How do I install it?
### __(Recommended)__ Using the Package Manager
__**[Set up my personal package repository](https://github.com/Driftini/w96pkgs/blob/main/README.md)**__, then install *Smoothie for MsgRoom* from the Package Manager.

That's all!

### Manually
Simple: download the latest release's CSS file and, in https://windows96.net, import it in `C:/user/appdata/MsgRoom/themes`.
Finally, open MsgRoom and in the menubar, go from **Session** to **Themes**, then choose **Smoothie**.

Obviously, all that's left to do now is import the file in the right path in Win96 and enable it in MsgRoom.

## Why this name?
No idea, really. An old (unrelated) stylesheet I made was called Pancake, so I guessed it would've been cool to keep naming themes after desserts.

## Where can I contact you?
I recommend joining the [Windows 96 official Discord server](https://discord.gg/KCTaM75).

Not only you can talk to me there, but you can also find a lot more people developing cool stuff for the website!
